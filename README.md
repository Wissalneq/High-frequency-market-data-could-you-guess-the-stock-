This project classifies stocks based on tick-by-tick order-book data, as part of the CFM challenge. The model uses GRU layers to process sequential market data and leverages feature engineering on prices, bid/ask sizes, and order types. Itâ€™s trained with cross-entropy loss using the Adam optimizer.
